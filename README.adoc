Short bash script to shrink the images inside a PowerPoint presentation (nearly) without loss of quality.

## Prerequisites

The main resizing is based on functions of link:https://imagemagick.org[ImageMagick] and some math you need to install:

- link:https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php[ImageMagick - Download]
- GNU Basic Calculator **bc** (see: link:https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/bc.1p.html[bc man page])

If you have LibreOffice installed, also EMF/WMF images will be resized. Make sure the ```soffice``` is in your path. On a Mac OS normally you will find the application in ```/Applications/LibreOffice.app/Contents/MacOS/```.

## Operation

The script take the first argument as PowerPoint presentation in pptx format to shrink.

It creates the folders:

extraction:: This folder contains the unzip presentation
toshrink:: The images (jpeg, png, gif) to shrink which are found by search in ``extraction/ppt/media``` on files greater than 250 kilobyte
resized:: The resized images

After resizing the references in the presentation are updated and the shrinked presentation will be zip as ```shrinked_```_<OriginalPresentationName>_.pptx
